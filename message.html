                <h2>Chairman's Message</h2>
                <p>Let me begin with our vision. Amrit Vidyalaya believes in creating leaders – children who will face
                    their
                    future with confidence, excitement and responsibility. We see a world where Amritians have made a
                    mark in
                    various walks of society – science, finance, health, sports, the arts and so on. Moreover, we see a
                    future
                    where Amritians are leading lives grounded in strong values of love, equality, freedom and truth. In
                    one
                    sentence, we believe in creating leaders with a terrific blend of Noble Hearts and Able Minds!</p>
                <br>
                <p>Visions only become real when there is a team of dedicated people who work very hard to make sure
                    that all
                    the actions are aligned to the large dream. The same is true for Amrit. We are very proud of and
                    grateful for
                    the team of teachers and staff who LIVE the Amrit values and put their every ounce of effort to
                    ensure that we
                    create an environment where children flourish.</p>
